* A route specifies how to match a request and what action to take when the request is matched.
*
* When a request matches on a route, the route can perform one of the following actions:
* - *Route* the request to a destination
* - Reply with a *Direct Response*
* - Send a *Redirect* response to the client
* - *Delegate* the action for the request to one or more [`RouteTable`]({{< ref "/reference/api/github.com.solo-io.gloo-mesh-enterprise.oss-imported.api.enterprise.networking.v1beta1.route.md" >}}) resources
* DelegateActions can be used to delegate the behavior for a set out routes to
