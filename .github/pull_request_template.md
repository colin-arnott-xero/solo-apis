# Note to developers
Generally we only merge API changes that are generated via our automation that is triggered by Gloo releases. 

If you are creating a branch in order to test the impact of an API change on solo-projects or other repo that depends on
solo-apis, open your PR as a draft or Work in Progress to prevent it from being merged automatically.
